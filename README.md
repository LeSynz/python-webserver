# Learning Python Web Server

I'm trying to learn Python, so I made this super basic web server.

It's a simple TODOs API that supports GET, POST, and DELETE requestsâ€”no frameworks, just Python.

## What I'm Doing

- Figuring out Python basics
- Playing around with web servers and HTTP methods
- Practicing code and writing docs

## How to Try

1. Make sure you have Python installed ([python.org](https://python.org))
2. Download or clone this repo
3. Run the server file (just Python, no extra stuff needed)
4. Use tools like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API

Good luck (to me)!
